# Love Data Week Workshop - Open Data and Analysis with Python

International Love Data Week is a global event held annually in February to raise awareness of the importance of research data management, sharing and reuse.

On February 16th, I ran a workshop with the Toronto Metropolitan Library that instructed students with different coding experiences on using **Python** with Open Weather Map's **WeatherAPI** to make basic calls and demo a simple weather program.

The program is a simple command line program that gives the user an option to either get the current weather of a specified city or get a weather forecast a specified city for 3 days.

People who attended this workshop found this as not only a helpful way of learning how to work with APIs but also a way to start using Python.
